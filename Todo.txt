- Test: 
    - Write Tests
- Passwords:
    - Encrypt and decrypt password in config -> in progress
    
- Send Password xor decrypted over udp

- IO:
    - Change IO Direction over iobroker

- General
    - Hide Sensor/Powermeasurement if not available
    - Sensor_1_Ready is always false
    - Add Units to IO Broker Datapoints for Sensor_1_Brightness;Sensor_1_Humidity;Sensor_1_Temperature



I know that it will be manual work but would it not be better to encrxpt the passwords stored here? I'm sorry but the auto-encrypt feature from cointroller can not be used in "arrays" :-(

I think it needs unneeded calls that you check the object existence on every write ... I think this is enough once (you can use a map /Objects-keys to remember which object was created/checked already for instance. Same for all the devices/channels in update method
-> todo: later


please add the default values for all configation options to io-package native https://github.com/dan1-de/ioBroker.anelhut/blob/main/io-package.json#L75-L78
-> fixed

it seems that info.connection is missing as object? https://github.com/dan1-de/ioBroker.anelhut/runs/2058555301#step:6:233 ... ideally add it to instanceObjects in io-package
-> fixed 

is the subscribe here https://github.com/dan1-de/ioBroker.anelhut/blob/75a6aee8e3dadb5f18d3a2a70da5b4cb70b9b2b9/src/main.ts#L118 really to be executed on every update? SHould not be a bigger issue, but still strange
-> fixed: added bool to check

I also think that the template code https://github.com/dan1-de/ioBroker.anelhut/blob/75a6aee8e3dadb5f18d3a2a70da5b4cb70b9b2b9/src/main.ts#L236-L282 can easiely be removed, or ?! ;-)
-> fixed

you need to clear all timeout and connections in https://github.com/dan1-de/ioBroker.anelhut/blob/75a6aee8e3dadb5f18d3a2a70da5b4cb70b9b2b9/src/main.ts#L288-L299 (e.g. the socket/dgram you open in your communication class
-> fixed

I would also see it as best practice to add a try catch around the socket bin call because it can fail if the port is already used or such.
-> fixed
